        <li>(Optional) Add other files to your respository to create more webpages. The url of these webpages are always <em>your respository's webpage url</em>+<em>the file name</em>. For example, the url of this website is "<code>https://mathcodeforfun.github.io/</code>" and the file of this webpage is"<code>Github-Sites.html</code>" so the url of this webpage is "<code>https://mathcodeforfun.github.io/MathCodeForFun.github.oi/Github-Sites.html</code>".</li><br>
        
        <li>Go to the settings of your respository and under the section of the sidebar that says "Code and automation", their is a button that says "Pages". Click on that button.</li><br>
        
        <li>Under the bold text that says "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".</li><br>
        
        <li>Under the bold text that says "Branch", use the dropdown menu to select a branch, then another dropdown menu will appear. You can select "/docs" or "/root".</li><br>
        
        <li>Press "Save".</li><br>
        
        <li>Go back to your respository. Below the button that says "Go to file", their will be a small, brown dot. When this dot is on your screen that means that your website is being created or updated. Wait until this dot becomes a green checkmark. If the dot becomes a red x, you must fix your website before you can visit it.</li><br>
        
        <li>Finally, once the green checkmark appears, you can visit your new website!</li>
